## Introduction

Sometimes you just need to disable some chrome extensions while keeping other chrome extensions enabled. For example, when you develop the react app, you may enabled the react devtools, redux devtools but disable all other extensions. With this extension, you create a category contained react devtools and redux devtools, then you can enable the extensions only in this category while disabled all the other extensions with one click. After done your job, you can go back with another click.

The extensions also enable you to disable all the extensions temporarily. Even better, it remembers which extensions where previously enabled and will re-enable them again with just one click.
